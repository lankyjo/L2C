<p className="mb-6"> Hello, Iâ€™m <strong>LankyJo</strong>â€”a passionate web developer, creative problem solver, and lifelong learner. My journey in technology began at a young age when I first discovered the magic of coding. I was fascinated by how a few lines of code could transform ideas into interactive experiences, and that curiosity has driven me ever since. </p> <p className="mb-6"> Over the years, I have immersed myself in web development, mastering <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, and diving into frameworks like <strong>React and Next.js</strong>. I love creating digital experiences that are not just visually stunning but also fast, responsive, and user-friendly. Whether it's refining UI interactions, optimizing performance, or exploring new design techniques, I thrive on building solutions that leave an impact. </p> <p className="mb-6"> While my focus is on frontend development, Iâ€™m also expanding my skills into <strong>backend technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, and Python</strong>. Iâ€™m currently learning how to build full-stack applications, and I enjoy solving real-world problems through <strong>AI</strong> and automation. </p> <p className="mb-6"> Beyond development, I have a growing interest in <strong>penetration testing</strong> and ethical hacking. Security has always intrigued me, and I aspire to become a <strong>penetration tester</strong>â€”someone who can identify vulnerabilities and help make digital systems safer. This journey is still unfolding, but Iâ€™m excited to explore more about <strong>offensive security, ethical hacking, and network defense</strong> as I continue learning. </p> <p className="mb-6"> When Iâ€™m not coding, I find inspiration in art, music, and deep conversations. I also enjoy pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible with <strong>Web3</strong> and emerging technologies. This blog is my creative outletâ€”a space where I share my projects, insights, and lessons learned along the way. </p> <p> Thank you for stopping by! Whether you're a fellow developer, security enthusiast, or just someone curious about tech, Iâ€™d love to connect and grow together. ðŸš€ </p>        </div>
